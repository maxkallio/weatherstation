The Weather Station project has reached a significant milestone with the completion of its design phase. While the physical box has not yet been manufactured, the design process provided valuable insights and set a strong foundation for future development. 

## Design Challenges and Solutions

1. **Looking Good:**
   - **What I wanted to achieve:** Create a visually appealing product.
   - **What went wrong:** Balancing aesthetics with functional requirements was challenging.
   - **How I tried to solve it:** I focused on a modern design with natural finishes.
   - **How I would approach it next time:** I would collaborate with design experts to explore innovative aesthetic solutions.

2. **Customizable Design:**
   - **What I wanted to achieve:** Allow the design to be easily modified for different needs.
   - **What went wrong:** Balancing customization with manufacturing constraints was difficult.
   - **How I tried to solve it:** I used Boxes.py to allow easy adjustments to the design.
   - **How I would approach it next time:** Develop modular elements that can be adapted or replaced as needed.

3. **Using Laser Cutter and Time Management:**
   - **What I wanted to achieve:** Efficiently use a laser cutter to create precise components for the box.
   - **What went wrong:** Managing time effectively while using the laser cutter was challenging due to scheduling conflicts and unexpected delays.
   - **How I tried to solve it:** I planned the cutting sessions in advance and optimized the design files to minimize cutting time.
   - **How I would approach it next time:** Allocate more buffer time for laser cutting sessions and explore alternative cutting methods to reduce dependency on a single tool.


## Reflections on Requirements

- **Eco-friendly Style:** The design plans to use 100% sustainable materials.
- **Lightweight Construction:** The design aims to minimize weight.
- **Easy Maintenance:** The design concept allows for quick access.

## Recommendations for Improvements

- **Prototyping and Testing:** Prioritizing creating physical prototypes to validate the design assumptions and making necessary adjustments. This step is crucial for identifying practical challenges.
- **User Feedback:** Plan to gather feedback from potential users once prototypes are available to identify areas for improvement and ensure the design meets user needs.
- **Documentation and Visualization:** Continuing to enhance documentation with detailed visualizations. Once prototypes are created, I will add pictures and videos to demonstrate the product's functionality and design.
