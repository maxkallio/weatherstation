# User Experience Design: Concept & Design

## Concept

### User and User Needs

**User description :** The primary users of the Weather Station are individuals or organizations interested in monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. 


**User Needs:**
- **Eco-friendly Style:** The box is made from sustainable materials, such as recycled wood or biodegradable plastics, to minimize environmental impact.
- **Lightweight Construction:** The choice of materials and design ensures that the box is easy to transport and install, without compromising on durability.
- **Easy Maintenance:** The box is designed with accessibility in mind, allowing users to easily open it for maintenance or upgrades without specialized tools.


**Metrics:** 
- **Eco-friendly Style:**  100% of the materials used in the box are sustainable, such as recycled or biodegradable materials.
- **Lightweight Construction:** the total weight of the weather station should not exceed 1 kg, making it easy to transport and install.
- **Easy Maintenance:** design the box so that it can be opened in under 2 sec without the need for specialized tools.

### Main Goal of the Design 

The main goal of the Weather Station design is to create an eco-friendly, lightweight, and easily maintainable device. 

### Product Requirements (SMART) for the Box

- **Specific:** The box must be constructed from 100% sustainable materials, such as recycled wood or biodegradable plastics, and should weigh no more than 1 kg. It must be designed for easy maintenance, allowing access without specialized tools.
- **Measurable:** The box should be able to be opened in under 2 seconds for maintenance or upgrades, ensuring quick and easy access to internal components.
- **Achievable:** The design of the box should incorporate standard manufacturing techniques to ensure it can be produced efficiently and at scale.
- **Relevant:** The use of sustainable materials and lightweight construction is crucial for reducing the environmental impact and enhancing the portability of the Weather Station.
- **Time-bound:** The design and production of the box should be completed within two months to align with the overall project timeline.

### Desired Physical Product

- **Eco-friendly Materials:** 
- **Compact and Lightweight:** 
- **Easy Access:** 
- **Design:** The box features a sleek and modern design, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.
