# Welcome to the Weather Station Project

The Weather Station project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and analyzing environmental data through a network of sensors. This blueprint serves as a guide for setting up, deploying, and managing the Weather Station application, which includes both embedded systems and web components.

Purpose of the Blueprint:
The primary purpose of this blueprint is to offer a structured approach to developing an IoT-based weather monitoring system. It aims to facilitate development, ensure consistency, enhance scalability, and improve user experience.

Technologies Used:
Backend: PHP for server-side scripting and handling API requests.
Database: MySQL (MariaDB) for storing sensor data, managed through Docker.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the user interface.
Deployment: Docker for containerizing the application, ensuring easy deployment and management.
