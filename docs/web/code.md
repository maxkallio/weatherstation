# Web Code

Front-End:

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a modern, responsive interface.
JavaScript manages data fetching with HTTP calls (e.g., Fetch API) to retrieve data from the back-end and dynamically display it on the webpage.
External resources like CSS, JavaScript files, and images are organized in separate directories, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
Back-End:

The back-end is structured in PHP, adhering to PSR-12 coding standards.
Code organization follows best practices with includes, functions, and classes to minimize repetition and improve modularity.
Documentation and Comments:

Each file includes author and description comments, with additional comments explaining complex parts to aid other developers.
